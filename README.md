## About the Dataset
- This dataset featuring Consumption of Electrical Blower Machine with timeslots of around 10-15 min. this data is recorded with help of IoT device.
- Energy Consumption is Measured between Current and Previous time stamp.
- Null or less than 0.5 value of Energy Consumption means machine was of during respective time slot time.
- Above time series consumption is Stationary with time as KWH i.e Kilo Watt/Hour Capacity of Blower motor is fixed.
